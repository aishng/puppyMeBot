Puppy Me Bot
==========

This is a complementary Zulip Bot that responds to dog emojis with adorable puppy gifs on Hacker School's internal chat program. It is a follow up to my previous web based <a href="https://github.com/ashleyglidden/puppyMe">Puppy Me</a> app.

The bot recognizes all three of the dog emojis, :dog:, :dog2:, :doge:, and responds with a random "cute puppies" gif from the GIPHY API. As shown below:
